# BOP
**_BOP!_** will provide a stunning visual experience, allowing users to stay up to date with new releases from the artists they love.

Created in SwiftUI using MVVM with Firebase integration, _BOP!_ is a passion project several years in the making. I found myself frustrated with a recurring problem: I would check the profile of an artist I enjoy listening to, only to find they released an album six months ago. How was I not aware of this release? I _love_ their music! For artists that do not have massive followings on social media, it can be easy for some of their work to slip through the cracks. I was committed to ensuring this pain point would come to an end.

Following numerous iterations of the designs, tech stack and just about every single other detail that goes into making an app, I finally settled on a finalised plan for _BOP!_. A stunning, highly stylised UI to keep users engaged, elegantly crafted with delightful transitions and animations in SwiftUI, with secure data storage using Firebase and Cloud Firestore. Remote notifications delivered via Cloud Functions will be used to ensure users are always kept up to date, with account creation and iPad support planned for the future.

Development for _BOP!_ is in full swing, and I am confident it will be a smash hit when it lands.
